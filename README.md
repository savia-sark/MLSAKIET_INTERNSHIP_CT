# Mixed Reality Solar System App

## Overview
Welcome to my Mixed Reality Solar System App! This project showcases an interactive simulation of the solar system that I developed using Unity and the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) for deployment on Microsoft HoloLens. Users can explore celestial bodies in a holographic environment, enhancing their understanding of the solar system.

## Developer Information
- **Name:** Sarthak Goel
- **Branch:** Computer Science Engineering (CSE)
- **University Roll No.:** 2300290100226
- **Section:** D
- **Year:** 2nd

## About Me
I am Sarthak Goel, a passionate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering from KIET Group of Institutions. I have a keen interest in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), and I aim to explore innovative ways to enhance user experiences through immersive technologies. This project reflects my dedication to learning and applying mixed reality concepts in practical applications.

## Project Structure
The application consists of two main scenes:

### 1. Main Scene
- **Features:**
  - Logo Display: A visually appealing logo is prominently shown.
  - Start Button: A user-friendly button that initiates the transition to the solar system scene.

- **Functionality:**
  - Users tap the start button to enter the solar system simulation, designed to focus attention on the action button.

### 2. Solar System Scene
- **Features:**
  - Holographic View: A 3D representation of the solar system for an immersive experience.
  - Skybox Toggle Button: Enables users to switch between different skybox environments.

- **Interactivity:**
  - Users can interact with the sun to initiate movement across the solar system, making the entire system rotate around it.

## Project Structure
### 1. Assets Folder
Contains:
- 3D models of celestial bodies (sun, planets, moons)
- Textures and materials
- UI elements (buttons, logos)
- Scripts for user interactions and scene transitions
- Audio files for sound effects

### 2. Builds Folder
Contains:
- The `.sln` file for compiling and deploying the application on HoloLens.
- Configuration files and build artifacts.

### 3. Additional Folders
- **Library:** Imported assets and project-related files for optimization.
- **Temp:** Temporary files generated during the build process.
- **Logs:** Debugging and performance tracking logs.
- **ProjectSettings:** Project configuration settings.

## Technical Implementation
### Tools and Technologies
- **Unity:** My primary development environment.
- **HoloLens 2 Emulator:** Used for testing and debugging.
- **MRTK:** Simplifies mixed reality development.
- **C# Scripting:** Used for functionality and user interactions.

### Scene Development
- **Main Scene:** Created using Unityâ€™s UI elements for logo and button positioning.
- **Solar System Scene:** Accurate positioning of celestial body models and implementation of the skybox feature for an immersive background.

### User Experience (UX)
I designed the app for intuitive navigation and seamless interactions, with visual feedback when interacting with the sun to enhance engagement.

## Testing and Deployment
### Testing
I conducted extensive testing using the HoloLens 2 Emulator, focusing on:
- Scene transitions
- Interaction responsiveness
- Visual quality and performance

### Deployment
The final version was packaged for HoloLens devices, ensuring compatibility with its features.

## Conclusion
The Mixed Reality Solar System App provides an engaging educational experience, combining technology and learning. I envision future enhancements that may include additional celestial bodies, educational content, and improved interactions.

## Future Work
- **Enhanced Educational Content:** Integrating information about celestial bodies.
- **Multiplayer Functionality:** Allowing real-time exploration with multiple users.
- **Advanced Interaction:** Implementing complex interactions like zooming in on planets.

This project serves as a foundation for my further exploration in mixed reality education. Enjoy your journey through the solar system!
