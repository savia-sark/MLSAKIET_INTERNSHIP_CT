Project Report: Mixed Reality Solar System App
Project Overview
This report outlines the development and functionality of a Mixed Reality (MR) application created using Unity, specifically designed for deployment on Microsoft HoloLens. The application provides an interactive simulation of the solar system, allowing users to explore celestial bodies in a holographic environment.

Project Structure
The app consists of two main scenes:

1. Main Scene
Features:
Logo Display: A visually appealing logo representing the application is prominently displayed on the screen.
Start Button: A user-friendly button that initiates the transition to the solar system scene.
Functionality:
Upon launching the app, users are greeted with the main scene where they can tap the start button to enter the solar system simulation. The scene is designed to be minimalistic to focus user attention on the action button.

2. Solar System Scene
Features:
Holographic View: The solar system is rendered in 3D, allowing users to experience a realistic representation of the solar system in a mixed reality environment.
Skybox Toggle Button: A button that enables users to toggle between different skybox environments, enhancing the immersive experience.
Interactivity:
Interaction with the Sun: Users can interact with the sun to initiate movement across the solar system. This interaction allows the entire solar system to rotate around the sun, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.

Project Structure
1. Assets Folder:
The Assets folder contains all the assets used in the project, including:
3D models of celestial bodies (e.g., sun, planets, moons)
Textures and materials for realistic rendering
UI elements such as buttons and logos
Scripts for handling user interactions and scene transitions
Audio files for any sound effects or background music
2. Builds Folder:
The Builds folder contains the necessary files for deployment to HoloLens, specifically:
The .sln file (solution file) which is used to compile and deploy the application on HoloLens devices.
Configuration files and other build artifacts required for successful deployment.
3. Remaining Necessary Folders:
Additional folders generated by Unity during the development process are organized accordingly. These include:
Library: Contains imported assets and other project-related files that Unity uses for optimization.
Temp: A temporary folder for files generated during the build process.
Logs: Includes log files for debugging and performance tracking.
ProjectSettings: Contains settings for the project, including graphics, input, and other configurations.

Technical Implementation:
Tools and Technologies:
Unity: The primary development environment used for building the application.
HoloLens 2 Emulator: Utilized for testing and debugging the app in a simulated HoloLens environment.
MRTK (Mixed Reality Toolkit): Employed to simplify the development of mixed reality experiences, providing components and features for spatial interactions and UI elements.
C# Scripting: Used for implementing functionality and user interactions within the app.
Scene Development
Main Scene: Created using Unity’s UI elements. The logo and button are positioned centrally for ease of access.
Solar System Scene:
3D models of celestial bodies were imported and positioned accurately relative to the sun.
The skybox feature was implemented using Unity’s Skybox material system, allowing for a more immersive background.
User interactions were programmed using Unity’s input system, enabling touch detection on the sun for movement control.

User Experience (UX):
The app was designed with user experience in mind, ensuring intuitive navigation between scenes and seamless interaction with the solar system.
Feedback mechanisms, such as visual cues when interacting with the sun, were incorporated to enhance user engagement.

Testing and Deployment:
Testing:
The app was extensively tested using the HoloLens 2 Emulator to ensure performance and usability. Key areas of focus included:
Scene transitions
Interaction responsiveness
Visual quality and performance optimization
Deployment:
The final version of the application was packaged for deployment on HoloLens devices, ensuring compatibility with the device’s capabilities and features.

Conclusion:
The Mixed Reality Solar System app developed using Unity provides an engaging and interactive experience for users. By combining educational content with immersive technology, the app fosters a deeper understanding of our solar system. Future enhancements could include additional celestial bodies, educational information, and improved interaction mechanics to further enrich the user experience.

Future Work:
Enhanced Educational Content: Integrating information about each celestial body for an informative experience.
Multiplayer Functionality: Allowing multiple users to explore the solar system together in real-time.
Advanced Interaction: Implementing more complex interactions, such as zooming in on planets or exploring their surfaces.
This project serves as a foundation for further exploration and development in the field of mixed reality education.
